# <div align='center'> Machine Failures Kaggle Playground </div>
### Overview
The objective of this project is to start using more complicated methods for machine learning. I used various types of machine learning algorithms, the two main differences from the concrete strength playground were the use of Stratified K Fold and Optuna to optimize the parameters of the algorithm. Even though I have done quite a few more playgrounds before this, in this competition I scored worse relative to my concrete strength submission getting a top 55% spot on Kaggle. There is still more I need to learn about optimization, but this was a good start in my opinion

### Prerequisites
To fully understand the process and the concepts used for this project, I would recommend having a good understanding of:

- Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- The Python Libraries Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Other Machine Learning Algorithms like XGBoost, Catboost, LightGBM
- The optimization library Optuna
